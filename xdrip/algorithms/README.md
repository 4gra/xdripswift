The algorithms folder has classes which define the Calibration and BgReading related algorithms.

Only algorithms, no data storage.
Also no read of access to data defined in other classes, the necessary data is passed when calling the functions.

There's a class for BgReading and Calibration, corresponding to the classes in the Spike and xdripplus projects.
