Project in development.

Goal is to port iosxdripreader to Swift

Current Status
- Supported transmitters :
    - no Blucon
    - G5 not recently tested, was tested 3 months ago and worked, my batteries are empty for the moment
    - MiaoMiao supported
    - G4 with xBridge supported
- no follower mode ==> this is my next priority
- no translations, English only
- no upload to Dexcom share servers
- no healthkit store
- no speak readings
- no sidiary
- no graph on the homescreen

Other restrictions
- sensor change detection not fully working, you might have to restart the app after placing the new sensor, maybe two times. I need more testing for this (next sensor replacement)
- only tested on iOS12
