Project in development.

Goal is to port iosxdripreader to Swift

Current restrictions (when comparing to iosxdripreader)
- no translations, English only
- no Blucon
- no upload to Dexcom share servers
- no healthkit store
- no speak readings
- no follower mode
- no sidiary
- no graph on the homescreen

Other restrictions
- sensor change detection not fully working, you might have to restart the app after placing the new sensor, maybe two times. I need more testing for this (next sensor replacement)
- only tested on iOS12
